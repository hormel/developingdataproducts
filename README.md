This repository contains the scrips for a shiny application to pull stock
quotes from Yahoo Finance and plot historical and forecasted prices.  The
user is able to select the stock ticker, the date range to sample and the
forecast range and confidence interval.  The forecast is based on the
mean return during the selected sample period (and associated variation).

Also included are an HTML5-based presentation on the application, created
via Slidify.
